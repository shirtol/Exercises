<!-- 
    *1. explain in your own words what is the problem.
    The problem is that we didn't add the property "position" to the outer div (the parent element) and set it to relative. 
    This property makes the properties of the inner div (the child element) be relative to the outer div.
 -->

<!-- 
     *2. fix the code using the positions weâ€™ve learned.
     I added position: relative to the #outer selector in the CSS file.
